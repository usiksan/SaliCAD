    <p>This mode is used to place components on the Plate, i.e. for placement.
      The arrangement is carried out manually with extensive use of automation
      technology, which allows you to maintain the quality of manual placement
      and increase the speed to automatic placement.</p>
    <p>1. Select the component or component group to place. This choice can be
      made in several ways:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1.1 Hover mouse over the component and click
      the left button. The component is selected and moved with the mouse cursor
      movement.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1.2 To select a group of components, click the
      left mouse button outside any component and without releasing it, cover
      the selection rectangle with the required group. When you release the left
      mouse button, the component group is highlighted and moved with the mouse
      cursor movement.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1.3 Enter the component ID in the I field of
      the part properties bar. The component is selected and moved with the
      mouse cursor movement.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1.4 Select the component in the component list
      in the box I. The component is selected and moved along with the movement
      of the mouse cursor.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">1.5 <b>Select the component in the schematic
        diagram.</b> This unique feature is only available in SaliCAD. Turn the
      mode choice component of the scheme - the G button in the part properties
      bar, select the sheet of the schema from which you want to choose
      component - list H the part properties bar and pressing the mouse button
      outside of any component will automatically open the selected sheet
      scheme. Left - click the component in the diagram that you want to place.
      When the sheet of the scheme closes, the component is selectedd and is
      carried along with the movement of the cursor.</p>
    <p>2. Set part properties.</p>
    <p>3. Specify the part insertion point. The part is placed in the Plate.</p>
    <p>4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the disposition of all parts.</p>
    The part properties are set using the part properties bar:
    <p><img src="propBarPartPlace.png" width="856" height="34" border="1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li><img src="mouseBLeft.png" width="32" height="48"> You can specify a
        point by clicking the left mouse button or manually.</li>
      <li><img src="mouseBRight.png" width="32" height="48"> The termination of
        the input is done by pressing the right mouse button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>"Smart" mode.</b></p>
    <p>Use smart mode to help you select the next component to placement. When
      the active function is a consistent choice - button F the part properties
      bar, the smart mode offers to the next component in the component with the
      next sequence number of the identifier, for example, if you selected the
      component R35, reasonable regime will offer to the next component R36.</p>
    <p>When the function of logical selection of the component is active - the E
      button of the part properties bar, the reasonable mode offers to insert
      the nearest local unplaced component in the schematic diagram.</p>

      or "space" - confirmation of "smart" input.</p>
