    <p>Disconnects the pin from the net (or the net from the pin). When moving
      components, the nets connected to the pins are extended, shortened or
      broken depending on the movement, but the connection between the pin and
      the net is not broken. In cases where it is undesirable to disconnect the
      net from the pins of the component.</p>
    <p>1. Specify the pin from which you want to disconnect the net.</p>
    <p>2. Repeat step 1 to disconnect all of the required nets.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to disconnect the group of pins at once. To do this,
      press the left mouse button and hold it to cover the group of disconnected
      pins with a rectangle. When you release the left mouse button, all the
      pins that fall into the enclosing rectangle are disconnected from the
      nets.</p>
