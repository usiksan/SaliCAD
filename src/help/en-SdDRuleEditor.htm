    <h1 align="center">Rules editor Dialog</h1>
    When you trace wires, a set of rules is used to control the trace
    parameters. These rules include:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>default road width</li>
      <li>the gap between the road and the road</li>
      <li>the gap between road and pad</li>
      <li>the gap between the pad and the pad</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Rules can be assigned to each net individually. If no rules are assigned to
    a particular net, the PCB rules are used, which are assigned by default and
    can be changed.<br>
    <br>
    This dialog is used to edit nets and PCB rules. The full list of available
    nets is presented in the list on the left. To edit the rules of the net,
    select the net in this list. Multiple nets can be selected. In this case,
    the rules will be set for all selected nets.<br>
    <br>
    The field group on the right is used to change the rules of the selected
    nets (left column) and the entire PCB (right column).<br>
    <br>
    For fast entering all gaps You can use All gaps field, if all gaps are the
    same. After entering these gaps, click Apply gaps and all gaps will be
    filled with the specified gap.<br>
    <br>
