    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Layers Dialog</h1>
    In this dialog box, you can see a list of available layers, the state of the
    layers, and their pairs (see <a href="layers.htm">layers</a>).<br>
    <br>
    In the Central part of the dialog there is a table with a list of available
    layers. Columns allocated to the name of the layer, the destination for the
    trace, status, visibility, color, and pairing.<br>
    <br>
    Clicking an <span style="color: fuchsia;">Trace</span> cell allows you to
    cycle through the possible layer assignments for the trace.<br>
    <br>
    Clicking on <span style="color: fuchsia;">State</span> cell allows you to
    cycle through the possible States of the layer.<br>
    <br>
    Clicking on the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Visibility</span> cell allows
    you to turn on or off the visibility of the layer. The layer is visible in
    the Enabled and Editable state. The layer is invisible in the Off state.
    Visibility is a graphical representation of the state of a layer.<br>
    <br>
    When you click on the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Color</span> cell, a
    dialog box for selecting a color for the layer appears. You can assign any
    color to the layers, including the same color. The color of layers is saved
    in Your profile on the computer. Another computer may have its own color
    palette.<br>
    <br>
    When you click on the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Pair name</span> cell,
    the <a href="SdDLayerList.htm">dialog</a> box for selecting a pair layer
    for this one appears.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color: fuchsia;">Tracing layers count in plate</span> field
    specifies the number of trace layers for a particular Board. Therefore, this
    field is active only when the layers dialog is called from the graphics card
    editor.<br>
    <br>
    When you click <span style="color: fuchsia;">Close</span>, the dialog box
    closes.<br>
    <br>
    When you click the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Create...</span>&nbsp;button
    a dialog box for creating a <a href="SdDLayerCreate.htm">new layer</a>
    appears.<br>
    <br>
    When you click <span style="color: fuchsia;">Delete</span>, the currently
    selected layer is deleted. Deletion is possible only if there is no
    information on this layer in any of the open projects.<br>
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <h3>Buttons to limit the displayed list of layers.</h3>
    </div>
    <br>
    The number of layers can be quite large, but only a limited number of these
    layers can be used at any given time. These buttons allow you to reduce the
    amount of information displayed. They do not affect the addition or removal
    of layers.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">Show actual</span>. The layers that are
        relevant for the graphical editor are shown. Ie a list of layers to
        "default".</li>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">Show used</span>. Layers on which some
        information is present are shown.</li>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">Show all</span>. All currently known
        layers are shown.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    When you click the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Hide all</span> button,
    the state of all layers changes to Off.<br>
    <br>
    When you click the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Switch all</span> button
    state of all layers switches to the next state, as if you were clicking the
    State for all layers box.<br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Download and save the state of layers</h3>
    Often, a specific set of layers is used for a particular type of operation.
    For example, to arrange the positional designations on the Board need images
    of the component, the Board and the positional designations themselves.
    Images of trace layers will only interfere, so it is logical to turn them
    off. To make it easier to work with such sets of enabled layers and use
    their loading and saving.<br>
    <br>
    When you click <span style="color: fuchsia;">Save...</span> a dialog box
    opens to select the path to save the current set of enabled layers.<br>
    <br>
    <p>When you click <span style="color: fuchsia;">Load...</span> opens a
      dialog to select a file containing the desired set of enabled layers. When
      you select this file, it is loaded, all layers are made invisible except
      those visible, which are recorded in this particular file.</p>
