    <h1 align="center">Registration Dialog</h1>
    <p>Registration is required to distinguish between users and authors of
      components to access the remote library and to solve synchronization
      problems. See. <a href="remoteLibrary.htm">remote library</a>.</p>
    <p> Each SaliCAD user must register with the Central library so that his or
      her name does not overlap with the names of other users of the System.</p>
    <p> Each user can have five working machines, i.e. one and the same person
      can work on five different computers, including simultaneously.</p>
    <p> When registering, the system generates an individual key for each user
      to access the Central library. An individual key is generated for each
      computer.</p>
    <p> This dialog box allows you to register with the Central library and
      register additional computers for a specific user.</p>
    <p> To register a user you need to fill in the fields:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">SaliCAD server IP</span> - IP address of
        the Central library server.</li>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">Name</span> - the name under which the
        user will be registered in the Central library. This name will also be
        written to the author field for all user-created objects.</li>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">EMail</span> - e-mail to be able to
        recover the key.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Leave the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Machine key</span> field blank.
      Upon successful registration, the key assigned by the Central library will
      appear here.</p>
    <p> The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Elements remain</span> field shows
      the number of items available for download from the Central library.</p>
    <p> To register, click the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Registration</span>
      button. The successful registration is indicated by the appearance of the
      key in the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Machine key</span> field.</p>
    <p> To register an additional computer for an existing user, complete the
      following fields:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">SaliCAD server IP</span> - IP address of
        the Central library server.</li>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">Name</span> - the name under which the
        user will be registered in the Central library. This name will also be
        written to the author field for all user-created objects.</li>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">EMail</span> - e-mail to be able to
        recover the key.</li>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">Machine key</span> - enter here the key
        of any registered computer of this user. Upon successful registration,
        this key will be replaced with a new one issued by the system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> To register a computer, click <span style="color: fuchsia;">Add machine</span>.
      Upon successful registration, a new key for this computer will appear in
      the key field. </p>
