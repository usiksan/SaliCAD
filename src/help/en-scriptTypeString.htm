    <hr>The text string type contains a text string in the form of a sequential
    set of characters. In scripts, strings are specified with quotation marks:<br>
    <br>
    "this is a string"<br>
    <br>
    The quotes themselves are not included in the string, but serve to define
    its boundaries.<br>
    <br>
    No operations are allowed for strings except vocation. Strings are also used
    in function calls.
