    <h1 align="center">Print Dialog</h1>
    <p> Use this dialog box to set print options and print the contents of the
      current editor. </p>
    <p> The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Printer</span> field contains the
      name of the printer to be printed on. Clicking the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Options</span>
      button opens a dialog box where you can configure the settings for the
      current printer or select another printer from the list of available
      printers. When you install the appropriate driver, you can print to a pdf
      file.</p>
    <p> The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Print manage</span> group of options
      allows you to specify the exact scale of the image output to print or to
      stretch the image to the entire sheet. By default, the image is stretched
      to the entire sheet.</p>
    <p> The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Orientation</span> group determines
      the vertical or horizontal position of the picture. By default, the
      orientation is selected to fill the sheet as much as possible.</p>
    <p> The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Print area</span> group allows you to
      select the rectangular area of the drawing to be printed. By default, the
      entire image is printed. If a part is selected in the picture, only the
      selected part can be printed. You can also specify the coordinates of the
      window whose contents will be printed. When you click <span style="color: fuchsia;">Select</span>,
      the print dialog box is hidden and the mode is enabled so that you can
      specify the dialog box directly in the image.</p>
    <p> The group of other parameters contains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="color: fuchsia;">copy count</span> - here you can see the
        number of copies to be printed</li>
      <li> <span style="color: fuchsia;">zero line width</span> - on the
        drawings of circuits and circuit boards some of the lines have the
        thickness equal to zero. When printing, the thickness of such lines is
        taken to be equal to the size of one point of the printer. For printers
        with high resolution, these lines may be too thin. In this field, you
        can specify the thickness for such lines in pixels (points) of the
        printer</li>
      <li> <span style="color: fuchsia;">color print</span> - by default, the
        picture is printed in black and white. That is, any elements are printed
        in black, and the background remains white, even if the printer allows
        color printing. By setting this flag, you can get a color printout on a
        color printer </li>
    </ul>
