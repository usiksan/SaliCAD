      editor</p>
    <p>The component editor is not a graphical editor, so there are no graphical
      modes in it. The component editor is a dialog form with which you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>set and view the schematic sections that make up the component</li>
      <li>set and view the correspondence of the pin numbers of the enclosure to
        the pin names of each section</li>
      <li>set and view component part</li>
      <li>set and view component parameters</li>
      <li>set and view component parameters table</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The upper topic of the form is used to work with schematic images of the
      component sections. From left to right are the following elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>preview window for the currently selected section</li>
      <li>the list of sections of the component. When you select a section in
        the list, it is displayed in the preview window, and the packing
        information is displayed in the table to the right</li>
      <li>the packing information table of the currently selected section. In
        this table presented correspondence of the pin numbers of the enclosure
        to the pin names of selected section. Each section has its own packing
        information table, which is included when you select the appropriate
        section</li>
      <li>buttons for working with sections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following buttons are used to work with sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Add section" Clicking this button enables the component section
        search and selection dialog box. After you select a section, it is
        inserted into the list of component sections</li>
      <li>"Duplicate" Clicking this button duplicates the currently selected
        section. This button is very useful when creating components with
        several identical sections</li>
      <li>"Select" Clicking this button enables the component section search and
        selection dialog box. After you select a section, it replaces the
        currently selected section of the component</li>
      <li>"Delete section". Clicking this button deletes the currently selected
        section</li>
      <li>"Delete all." Clicking this button deletes all sections of the
        component</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the sections manipulations can be undo.</p>
    <p>The middle topic of the form is used to work with parts. From left to
      right are the following elements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>preview window of the current component part</li>
      <li>the name of the component part</li>
      <li>button to select the component part. When you click this button, the
        component part search and select dialog box is enabled. After selecting
        the part, it is set to "default" for this component</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The lower right topic of the form is used to work with the component
      parameters. For this purpose serve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>table of component parameters. This table is a table of the form
        "key-value", where "key" is the name of the parameter, and "value" is
        the value of the parameter. Parameter values can be changed directly in
        the parameter table</li>
      <li>to work with the parameters themselves, use the group of buttons</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"Add parameter" When you click this button, you are prompted to
          enter the parameter name first and then its value. The parameter is
          then inserted with the value into the parameter table. If the table
          already has a parameter with the same name, it is replaced with the
          newly entered one</li>
        <li>"By default" When you click this button, a dialog box appears with a
          list of <a href="SdDParamDefault.htm">default settings</a>. It allows
          you to select a set of parameters to be inserted. This dialog box
          eliminates errors associated with entering parameters manually</li>
        <li>"Copy" When you click this button, the component search and select
          dialog box is enabled. After you select a component, its parameters
          are copied to the current component. The original component itself is
          not changed</li>
        <li>"Delete" Clicking this button deletes the current setting</li>
        <li>"Variant table...". When you click this button, the dialog box for
          viewing and editing for the component parameters table is enabled</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
