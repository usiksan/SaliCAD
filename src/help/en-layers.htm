    <p><a href="contents.htm">Contents</a>=&gt;Layers</p>
    <p>The system has a well-established system of layers. That is, each graphic
      element is located in one of the registered layers. The layer is used to
      group graphical elements. Layers differ in their identifiers. The
      identifier consists of two parts: a class and a modifier. The identifier
      can also be any sequence of characters. The presence of built-in classes
      and modifiers allow you to maintain a consistent system of layers in
      different workplaces, regardless of the number of practically used layers.<br>
    </p>
    <p>On the local machine, each layer (identifier) contains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name. Any sequence of letters and signs.</li>
      <li>Color. Any of the colors allowed in your system. If the color you
        specify cannot be displayed by Your system, the closest of the allowed
        colors is selected.</li>
      <li>State. A layer can be in one of the following States:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>the layer is turned off. Elements drawn in this layer on the screen
          and on the printer are not displayed and are not editable.</li>
        <li>the layer is turned on. Elements drawn in such a layer are displayed
          on the screen and on the printer, but access to them for editing is
          closed, i.e. editing elements drawn in the layer which on is
          impossible.</li>
        <li>the layer is edited. Elements drawn in such a layer are displayed on
          the screen and on the printer, in addition they can be edited.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The type of trace elements on the layer. That is, this layer is used
        in the tracing process and the corresponding elements are displayed on
        it:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>pad - used to display pads<br>
        </li>
        <li>mask - used to display solder mask</li>
        <li>stencil - used to display stencil holes for screen printers<br>
        </li>
        <li>hole - used to display holes in pcb</li>
        <li>road - used to display tracing roads</li>
        <li>polygon - used to display tracing polygons</li>
        <li>border - used to display tracing borders</li>
        <li>keep out - tracing keep out areas</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Pair layer. The paired layer is used to display elements from this
        layer when the component is moved to the lower side of the Board.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The layer system forms a stack of display layers. In addition to the
      display layer stack, there is another layer stack - the trace stack.
      Layers mapping in the stack trace is done automatically by setting the
      modifier to the ID of the layer. Multiple visual layers can be mapped on a
      single trace layer. For example, the layer "PCB pad on top" and the layer
      "PCB polygon on top" are both mapped to the top trace layer.</p>
    <p>There is a default layer system, but you can add, edit, and delete
      layers. When you save a project, the used layers are saved by ID. The
      current state of the layers is stored on the local machine. Therefore, if
      you download someone else's project, It will be displayed in your colors,
      not the colors of the project developer. That is, any project you have
      downloaded will have a familiar look. If your project contains layers that
      are not present on your system, they are automatically added with default
      values.</p>
    <p>Adding layers can be done manually.</p>
    <p>Layers can be deleted only manually and only if there is no information
      on the layers to be deleted in all loaded projects. If you load a project
      that contains a deleted layer, it is automatically added.</p>
