    <p>This mode is used to trace printed connections on the Board - i.e.
      tracing. Tracing is done manually with extensive use of automation
      technologies, which allows you to maintain the quality of manual tracing
      and increase the speed to automatic tracing.</p>
    <p>A predefined system of tracing rules is in effect during the tracing
      process.</p>
    <p>1. Select the beginning of the road. The beginning of a road can be
      located on the component pin, on the via, at the end of another road, or
      in the middle of another road. When you move the mouse, the future start
      of the road is indicated by a marker. Automatically searches for the
      beginning of a track at the nearest pin, via, or end of another road.</p>
    <p>To start the road in the middle of another road you need to bring the
      mouse close to the right place. The catcher to the middle of the road
      works at a grid step distance. Therefore, to make the guidance more
      accurate, you should reduce the grid step.</p>
    <p>The name of the net shown by the catcher is displayed in the status bar.</p>
    <p>Click left button to enter the starting point of the road.</p>
    <p>2. The parameters of the new road and its net are displayed in the road
      properties bar. The current road width is displayed in field C. It is
      taken from the trace rules. The net name to which the road belongs is
      displayed in the D field.</p>
    <p>3. Specify the road properties and adjust the build.</p>
    <p>The current layer is displayed in the B field of the road properties bar.
      When you change the current layer, a via is automatically inserted at the
      start point of the segment. Type of the via is specified using fields I.
      You can choose the previously formed vias in the field of I. To form a
      description of a new type of the via press K.</p>
    <p>Switching layer and the insertion of the via is also carried out if you
      click with the mouse exactly to the starting point of the segment. This is
      usually possible if you use a grid to trace - the E button of the road
      properties bar is pressed.</p>
    <p>4. When you move the mouse, it automatically searches for the end point
      of the road. It can be on the pin or on another end point of road of
      current net. To the end point hit the other road of the current net you
      need to bring the mouse close to the right place. In this case, the
      catcher works at a grid step distance. Therefore, to make the guidance
      more accurate, you should reduce the grid step.</p>
    <p> If possible, the automatic tracer builds a path from the start point to
      the end point. It works on the same layer as the current segment. He also
      uses tracing rules and the current setting of the width of the road.</p>
    <p>5. Specify the next point of the polyline of the road. In this case, the
      next segment of the road is inserted into the Board.</p>
    <p>Pressing the Backspace key cancels the last point and remove last road
      segment. This allows you to re-trace the path.</p>
    <p>6. Repeat steps 3-5 to form the entire polyline.</p>
    <p>7. If the next polyline point coincides with the end point, the polyline
      input is automatically stopped.</p>
    <p>You can enter the entire circuit built by the automatic tracer by
      pressing the middle mouse button or the "space".</p>
    <p>If the active button F in the road properties bar, when you insert the
      last point of the polyline is the automatic deletion of the loop. This
      mode is useful for redrawing individual paths.</p>
    <p>Road and input parameters are set using the road properties bar:</p>

    </ul>
    <p><b>"Smart" mode.</b></p>
    <p>Intelligent mode automatically traces the circuit from the current point
      to the end point.</p>
