    <p>Tool bar: <img src="select.png" width="24" height="24" border="1"></p>
    <p>Menu: Draw|Select and edit</p>
    <p>Cursor: <img src="cursorSelect2.png" width="32" height="32" border="1"></p>
    <p>Use this mode to select, copy, move, and delete objects. When you move
      the cursor over the surface of the graphical editor window, its appearance
      changes depending on whether the cursor is over the object or not. If the
      cursor is not over the object, it has the form <img src="cursorSelect2.png"
        width="32" height="32" border="1">. If the cursor is over an object, its
      appearance also depends on whether the object is selected or not. If the
      cursor is over an object and the object is not selected, the cursor takes
      the form <img src="cursorSelect4.png" width="32" height="32" border="1">.
      If the cursor is over the selected object, it has the form <img src="cursorSelect5.png"
        width="32" height="32" border="1">, in addition, if the cursor is over
      the selected object and the Ctrl key is pressed, the cursor has the form <img
        src="cursorSelect6.png" width="32" height="32" border="1">.</p>
    <p>Object selection:</p>
    <p>To select an object you need to click on it (the cursor has the form <img
        src="cursorSelect4.png" width="32" height="32" border="1">) the left
      mouse button.</p>
    <p>To select a group of objects it is necessary not over the object (the
      cursor has a form <img src="cursorSelect2.png" width="32" height="32" border="1">)
      to press the left mouse button and without releasing it to cover with a
      dashed rectangle the group of objects to be selected, thus the cursor has
      a form <img src="cursorSelect9.png" width="32" height="32" border="1">.
      Release the left mouse button when the coverage is complete.</p>
    <p>To select other objects in addition to the selected objects, hold down
      the Shift key. Additional objects are selected either individually (the
      cursor has a form <img src="cursorSelect4.png" width="32" height="32" border="1">)
      or as a group, and the cursor has a form <img src="cursorSelect9.png" width="32"
        height="32" border="1">.</p>
    <p> When objects are selected, their current properties are displayed in the
      corresponding properties panel, which changes depending on the type of
      selected elements. The properties of the selected elements can be changed
      directly in the properties panel. At the same time, property changes are
      instantly reflected on the selected objects. If objects with different
      property bars are selected, the property bar is displayed only for the
      same objects. At the same time, changes made from the properties panel to
      these objects do not affect other objects.</p>
    <p> To remove the selection of objects you need to click the mouse over the
      object.</p>
    <p>You can move, copy, and delete selected objects.</p>
    <p>To delete the selected objects, press the Delete key.</p>
    <p>To copy the selected objects, press and hold the Ctrl key, click the left
      mouse button over the selected objects and, without releasing the left
      mouse button, specify the new location of the copies of objects. Objects
      can be copied both within a single window and between the Windows of one
      or more projects. When you copy, the cursor is in the form <img src="cursorSelect6.png"
        width="32" height="32" border="1">.</p>
    <p>To move the selected objects, click the left mouse button above the
      selected objects and, without releasing the left mouse button, specify the
      new location of the objects. When you move the cursor, it looks like <img
        src="cursorSelect7.png" width="32" height="32" border="1">.</p>
    <p>When transferring and copying various objects, there are some features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>when transferring lines, if the selection was carried out for the tip
        of the segment, then this tip is transferred, the other tip remains in
        place, and the segment is deformed accordingly. This allows you to
        quickly change the length and direction of the segments;</li>
      <li>when you move rectangles, if the selection was made at the corner of
        the rectangle, then only this angle is transferred, and the opposite
        remains in place, and the rectangle is deformed accordingly. This allows
        you to quickly resize rectangles;</li>
      <li>copying identifiers and values is not possible at all;</li>
      <li> when you copy the legs of the character numerical indexes in the
        names of the legs are increased by 1;</li>
      <li>when copying the legs of the body digital indexes in the numbers of
        the legs are increased by 1;</li>
      <li>separate copying of the name or number of the leg is not possible;</li>
      <li>the anchor point is not transferred or copied;</li>
      <li>when transferring chain segments, if the selection of the chain was
        carried out for the tip, then only this tip is transferred, the other
        tip remains in place, and the segment is deformed in the orthogonal
        direction; when transferring segments associated with it, the segments
        are deformed accordingly in orthogonal directions, the associated
        components are also transferred;</li>
      <li>when you move components, the associated chain segments are deformed
        in orthogonal directions accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Selected objects can be rotated around a point. For rotation is a mode
      of rotation.</p>
