    <h1 align="center">Enter bus nets dialog</h1>
    <p>In this dialog You define net list for fast enter bus.
      Net list can be entered or selected from previously entered list.
      You can also select one previously entered list and edit it.
    </p>
    <p>Net list format is:</p>
    <p>Net1[,...]</p>
    <p>where Net1 represents net name. When You enter net list
      with this dialog You can not use commas in net names because it used
      as net delimiter.
      If some nets have same name but different index then You can use
      short description:</p>
    <p>same_name_letters&lt;start_index:stop_index&gt;</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p>D&lt;0:3&gt;,+5V,Gnd,A&lt;0:2&gt; will produce next net list result</p>
    <p>D0<br>
      D1<br>
      D2<br>
      D3<br>
      +5V<br>
      Gnd<br>
      A0<br>
      A1<br>
      A2</p>
    <p>The right part of the dialog contains a list of all named nets, i.e.
      those nets whose names were entered manually. Nets with automatic names
      are not represented in this list. When you select a net from this list, it
      is automatically placed in the bus list.</p>
