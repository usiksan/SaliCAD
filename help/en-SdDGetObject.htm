    <h1 align="center">Find and get object dialog</h1>
    <p>Use this dialog to find and enter an object from the library.</p>
    <p>The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Categories</span> topic contains a
      hierarchical list of object categories. By default, this list comes with
      SaliCAD and is presented in English.</p>
    <p>When you select a category in the list, the component selection is
      filtered by that category. Because categories are a hierarchical list,
      when you select a parent category, all objects in the child categories of
      that parent category are included in the selection list.</p>
    <p>The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Fields filter</span> topic contains a
      list of all fields of the currently found objects. By specifying values in
      the fields of this filter, you can shorter the list of found objects.</p>
    <p>The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Name</span> field contains a set of
      words to search for an object by name. Words in this field are separated
      by spaces. You can use it to search for parts of words. The list of found
      objects includes only those whose names contain ALL the words from this
      field.</p>
    <p><span style="color: fuchsia;">Expand param table</span> flag. If this
      flag is not checked, only the components are included in the search
      result. If this check box is checked, components for each row of this
      table will be formed for components that have a table of parameters. For
      example, for resistors, if the flag is not checked, the search will result
      in only one resistor, and if checked, the search will result in a set of
      resistors with all the values from the parameter table.</p>
    <p>The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Find list</span> topic contains a list
      of all found components that meet the search criteria.</p>
    <p>The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Sections</span> topic contains a table
      of sections of the currently selected component from the search Results
      table. If you are not looking for a component, this section will be empty.</p>
    <p>The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Symbol</span> topic contains a preview
      of the selected section of the current component - for components. The
      diagram image is for the fragment. The symbol image is for the symbol.
      This section will be empty for the corpus.</p>
    <p>The <span style="color: fuchsia;">Part</span> topic provides a preview
      part of the current component - for components. Part view itself - for
      component part. For other objects this section will be empty.</p>
    <p>When you click <span style="color: fuchsia;">OK</span>, the current
      section of the current component is selected - for the component or the
      object itself - for other objects, and the selection dialog is closed.</p>
    <p>When you click <span style="color: fuchsia;">Cancel</span>, the
      selection dialog is closed and the object is considered unselected.</p>
    <p>Objects are searched among all available objects including the remote
      repository. If the object was found in the remote repository and has not
      yet been loaded into the local library, its view will not be available. To
      download an object from a remote library, click the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Load
        from central repo</span> button.</p>
