    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Pads</h1>
    <br>
    In SaliCAD pins of parts characterized by type. To bind to a specific pad,
    use the Pad Association. It represents the mapping table of the pin types
    the pads. This approach allows you to change the parameters of the pads
    depending on the technology of the PCB, which gives flexibility.<br>
    <br>
    Pads is constructed by the system SaliCAD automatically based on the
    description of the pads for each particular application. This design is
    transparent to the developer and does not require any additional steps to do
    so. For example, for a Via for a two-sided plate, you need to form two
    sites: on the upper and lower layers. For a four-layer plate it is necessary
    to form already four platforms. In SaliCAD, you describe only one site, and
    the others are generated automatically if necessary.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the actual images on the trace layers of the site contain a
    description of the hole (if necessary), a description of the solder mask and
    a description of the stencil for printing solder paste.<br>
    <br>
    In the current version of SaliCAD only circular holes are allowed.<br>
    <br>
    Solder mask follows the contour of the contact area with a certain gap.<br>
    <br>
    <p>The opening of the stencil for printing solder paste in the simplest case
      repeats the contour of the contact pad with a certain gap. If the contact
      area is large, it is recommended to split this large hole into an array of
      small holes. The description of the contact area allows this possibility.</p>
