    <h1 align="center">Save to library dialog</h1>
    In addition to components, symbols (schematic diagrams of components) and
    parts, you can save entire schematic sheets to the library for later use. A
    typical application of the stored sheets are drawing shapes. The schematic
    sheets are saved in the library with its project. Therefore, inserting a
    fragment is always successful because all the necessary information is
    stored with the fragment.<br>
    <br>
    In this dialog box, enter the name of the fragment under which the schematic
    sheet will be saved in the library. By default, the file name is suggested
    as such.<br>
