    <h1 align="center">Value row selection Dialog</h1>
    The nominal value of some elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors)
    corresponds to a certain "series". A series is a set of standard values that
    are repeated for each order. This dialog allows you to select one value from
    the specified series.<br>
    <br>
    The left part shows groups of values. Each group covers several orders,
    depending on the agreements. For example, for resistors - it is three orders
    of magnitude per group. For capacitors-three and six orders of magnitude.<br>
    <br>
    The right part lists the values from the selected group.
