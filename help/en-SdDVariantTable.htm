    <h1 align="center">Variant table Dialog</h1>
    Very often, the components have the same part and the same schematic
    diagram, but several different parameters. For example, the resistors have
    different value and tolerance. To reduce the amount of information that is
    entered for these components, a variant table is used. It contains a list of
    different parameters for such components and the values of these parameters.
    When you select components when you insert a component into a schematic
    diagram, the component that has a table can be displayed as a single
    component or as a set of components with different values from this table.<br>
    <br>
    <p>For example, for the Resistor component, the value and tolerance fields
      can be represented in the case table. Other parameters can be name. Assume
      that the name field is set to "smd-0201", and the case table is as
      follows:</p>
    <table border="1" width="100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>value</td>
          <td>tolerance</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1kOm</td>
          <td>5%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2kOm</td>
          <td>10%</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p></p>
    <p>Than for selection will be available two components of Resistor. First
      component</p>
    <p>name - "smd-0201", value - "1kOm", tolerance - "5%"</p>
    <p>and second component</p>
    <p>name - "smd-0201", value - "2kOm", tolerance - "10%"</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The name field is not present in the case table, so it will be the same
      for all components. The fields that are present in the case table will be
      formed from the contents of the rows of this table.<br>
      <br>
      This dialog is used to create and edit such variant tables.</p>
    <p>The left part of the dialog box contains a table of registered fields.
      The right - hand side is the variant table.</p>
    <h3>Field table</h3>
    <p>This table lists all available registered fields for this component. You
      can edit this list by using the component editor. You can add any of these
      fields to the variant table. If the field is added to the variant table,
      the value of this field may be different for different variants of this
      component. If the field is not added to the table of variants, the value
      set for this field by default will be used for all variants of this
      component. The visual table consists of three columns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>has variant</li>
      <li>param name</li>
      <li>param value</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      Use the <span style="color: fuchsia;">has variant</span> column to add or
      remove fields from the variant table. To add a field to the table of
      variants it is necessary to check for this field, and to remove a field
      from the table of variants - to remove a check.</p>
    <h3>Variant table</h3>
    <p>This table has a variable number of columns depending on the number of
      fields to be changed depending on the variant. To add or remove columns,
      use the field table on the left. The "<span style="color: fuchsia;">has
        variant</span>" column is responsible for the presence of a field in the
      variant table. You can also add a field that is not in the default field
      list. To do this, use the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Append field</span>
      button. Use the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Delete field</span> button
      to delete fields.<br>
      <br>
      To add a row to the table, click <span style="color: fuchsia;">Insert row</span>
      button. The new row is inserted directly under the current selected row
      and all values in the new row are copied from the current one. It remains
      only to edit them. This approach simplifies the work, because very often
      not all fields are changed, but only part of them.<br>
      <br>
      To delete a row, click the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Delete row</span>
      button. This deletes the currently selected series.<br>
      <br>
      To delete all rows of the table, click the <span style="color: fuchsia;">Delete
        all</span> button.</p>
