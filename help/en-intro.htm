    <p>Computer aided design system SaliCAD aimed for schematic design of
      electronic equipment products, as well as for the design of printed
      circuit boards and wire installation based on the schematic diagram.</p>
    <p>This program is simple but powerful tool for creation electronic
      schematic diagram and printed circuit boards. Program is free to use and
      deploy.</p>
    <p>This document is a guide to the practical use of the SaliCAD system and
      is intended mainly for beginners. Those who want to make the most of this
      system are advised to refer to the technical documentation of the system.
      In this sense, help system is a particularly complete document.</p>
    So, this system is intended, first of all, for electronics schematic and pcb
    engineers, as well as for students, in general, for all who need a
    convenient and intuitive tool for creating schematic diagrams in accordance
    (or without) with the national standard.<br>
    <p>Unlike traditional systems of this kind, where each individual tool is
      represented by a separate program, the SaliCAD system is a fully
      integrated system, in which all the necessary tools are built, and
      additional tools can be connected, and working with these additional tools
      is no different from the built-in, so it seems to work with only one
      program.</p>
    Traditional CAD systems create their own file for each type of data, so
    typically a single project takes up a lot of files, which are often very
    difficult to understand, especially for large projects. SaliCAD, in
    contrast, supports a general trend of integrated document, i.e. all required
    for a project contained in a single file. In addition, full integration
    allows all changes in the schematic immediately reflect in the PCB. Thus,
    for example, to add a wire, you need switch to the diagram sheet and add the
    wire with the appropriate tool. After that, switching to the PCB, you can
    immediately begin to trace it. In SaliCAD there is no need of different
    operations to link, export fees or import back.<br>
    <p>Traditionally, as in other similar CAD systems, SaliCAD uses The
      following development algorithm:</p>
    <p>Schematic diagram -&gt; Printed circuit board</p>
    <p>The cornerstone of circuit design is the scheme. Therefore, a significant
      number of improvements in the SaliCAD system falls on the schematic
      editor. In contrast to the traditional paper approach, where you have to
      draw each element, the relationship between the elements, as well as to
      carry out the design, the CAD work is built a few friend.</p>
    Often, the elements from which schemes are built are already specified in
    the so-called component libraries. Therefore, drawing a diagram instead of
    the traditional drawing of lines, circles, etc.turns into work on the
    construction of existing "bricks", which serve as library elements. Like the
    builder, in addition to elementary building blocks using a larger design to
    build their buildings, the designer in the system SaliCAD can use a library
    of fragments to build their circuits. A fragment is a part of a diagram that
    represents a functional node or simply a larger construction than an
    component. And the choice of libraries of elements or fragments is clear and
    simple, and provides a preview of the element or fragment, so you can
    visually assess what you intend to insert.<br>
    <p>Therefore, the first step in creating a diagram is to insert the elements
      or fragments that make up the diagram. After that, you should set the
      electrical connections between the elements. To specify these
      relationships are wires. Unfortunately, there is no escape from the task
      of circuits to the schematic designer and this work is the most
      time-consuming when drawing the circuit, in the SaliCAD system everything
      is done to facilitate this important process to the engineer.</p>
