    <p>The model type is a complex object forming a 3d model.</p>
    <img src="file:///home/asibilev/work/SaliCAD/help/3dModel.png" alt="1" title="1">
    <p>Each model consists of a list of bodies that are displayed one or more
      times in the position specified by the copy matrix. Each model contains at
      least one copy matrix. For example, the image of the chip body will
      contain one copy matrix, and the image of the legs will contain several,
      according to the number of legs of the chip.<br>
      <br>
      The list of bodies consists of one or more bodies. Each body is a
      collection of a <a href="scriptTypeFaceList.htm">set of surfaces</a>
      represented by one common color. Thus, a body is a <a href="scriptTypeFaceList.htm">set
        of surfaces</a> that are displayed in one color.<br>
      <br>
      Only assignment operation is available with models. Models are also used
      in function calls. Models can be created, bodies can be added to the list
      of bodies, and a copy matrix can be added to the list of copy matrices.</p>
