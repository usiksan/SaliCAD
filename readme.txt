# SaliCAD
Integrated schematic and pcb layout multiplatform CAD

SaliCAD is a schematic and PCB layout CAD system. It is intended for creating and editing schematic diagrams for electronic devices, automatically creation PCB elements placement, editing PCB elements placement, handle and semiautomatic wiring layout creation and edition. In all modes it support maximum intelligence for minimization handle work.

About 20 years ago I begin creation this system. For 15 year ago at common it was completed on Windows platform with Borland BC5 IDE. It's name was PasCAD. It has help system, animated teach module with audio explanation. Interface only Russian. For next years system progress to support more and more functions. But at now I move to Linux and last 7 year I work on Qt. So, a time ago I choose to rewrite system on Qt with multiplatform support, remote component base repository, JSON file format for interplatform and Internet changeover, multilanguage support and so on.
